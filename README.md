-What to expect from the app

1. Ofcourse not all the functionality is implemented this can be enhanced in so many ways but basic things are done and can be replicated.
2. You can see People on first page, also can search people by typing in search box.
3. Also you can navigate by using pagination at the bottom. Ant Designs are used in the project for different components.
4. You can see associated relationship of People with starwars and planets on the card.
5. You can click on the box to see more details related to People and relationships with Planet and Starwars.
6. Just to show you that Other pages can also be implemented in same way by using many ways in the app.
7. Earlier I have submitted version using javascript because of the busy schedule in office I was not able to implement other details. Thanks :)
